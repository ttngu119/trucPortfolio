                        We are living in an era that is  driven by technologies and online services, saving and organizing recipes has never been easier with a digital app across all of your devices . We are developing a web app that allows users to find, create, and keep recipes in one single place. By copying and pasting (or typing if you wish) any recipes on the internet, you can create a quick and easy recipe keeper that can be accessed anytime.  <br>
                        Basic features of the application include generating and storing recipes, searching recipes, user authentication, visual interaction, and food items purchasing. Our goal is to make life more convenient for our clients, so they can spend more time sharing delicious food with friends and family.
